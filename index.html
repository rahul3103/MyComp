							<h4>Possibly broke spacetime</h4>
							<p>A health care provider is an individual or an institution that provides preventive, curative, promotional or rehabilitative health care services in a systematic way to individuals, families or communities.
 							An individual health care provider (also known as a health worker) may be a health care professional, an allied health professional, a community health worker, or another person trained and knowledgeable in medicine, nursing or other allied health professions, or public/community health. Institutions (also known as health facilities) include hospitals, clinics, primary care centres and other service delivery points. The practice of health professionals and operation of health care institutions is typically regulated by national or state/provincial authorities through appropriate regulatory bodies for purposes of quality assurance. Together, they form part of an overall health care system.</p>

							<h4>Snapped dark matter in the wild</h4>
							<p>Healthcare payors are entities other than the patient that finance or reimburse the cost of health services. A payor can be categorised into Government Payors or Private Payors. In most cases, this term refers to insurance carriers, other third-party payers, or health plan sponsors (employers or unions).
							Payer organizations worldwide are focused on managing the gap between funding and medical costs, often in the context of a changing regulatory environment. 
							Insurance carriers : 
							Insurance carriers come in many forms that can provide various types of policies, such as property and casualty, life insurance and medical or health insurance, to individuals and businesses, depending on their needs. Various activities are performed by an insurance carrier, including the underwriting of a policy prior to issue. An insurance carrier not only sells insurance policies but also pays claims that insureds make on their policies. 
							Third Party Payers:
							Any organization such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Medicare, Medicaid or other commercial insurance company that is the payor for coverages provided by a health plan.</p>
